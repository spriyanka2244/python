why do need self
To define current object of those method

c1 who is calling c2 is whom to compare
c1 is self and c2 is other

class computer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name="ram"
        self.age=23
           
    def compare(self,other): #the method of compare
        other.name="raim" #self is c1,c1 is calling and c2 is compare
        if self.name==other.name:
            return True
        else:
            return False
        
c1=computer()
c2=computer()

if c1.compare(c2): #compare is not a in built function so define method
    print("same of {0} ",format(c1.name))
else:
    print("different of {1} ",format(c2.name))



>>> %Run 1.py
different of {1}  raim
